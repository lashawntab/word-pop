# Welcome to Word Pop!

## How to play
Click on the letters that belong to the word, avoid those that don't. That's it!
Do it fast enough before the time runs out!  

## Score (At the top)
- +5 points:  For a valid letter, Pop's face is shown.
- -10 points:  For an invalid letter, nothing changes, but your points.
- +20 points:  Found ALL letters, before time ran out.
- -1 try: Time ran out before finding all letters.

In all of these cases, the board will reset and show a new word.

## How To Win  :)
It's the game that keeps on giving.

## How to Lose, Game Over  :(
You were given 3 tries, but you used them all.  
With more time could  improve with ways to earn new tries.

Good luck.  Thank you for playing!

FUTURE SCOPE:

Provide more feedback to player
Configurable complexity levels through word size (currently 5 letter limit)
Enable ways to earn more "tries"
Enable advancement levels and incentives
Automatically start new word when player has found all letters
Extend to use special characters and numbers.
Use a picture instead of a word.
Hide the word after some time and go by memory.

KNOWN ISSUES:

If the words are not changing, it is due to Mixed Content Mode. In Chrome, enable the unsafe script loading :( 
If this were a real production quality site, a proper license would be retrieved for a word generator that supports https.

Currently, using http://setgetgo.com/randomword/
